DATABASE SCHEMA UPDATE FOR GOOGLE AUTHENTICATION
--------------------------------------------

To support Google authentication in the ShelfSwap application, you need to modify the users table to add an 'auth_provider' column that tracks how the user authenticated.

1. Execute the following SQL command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN auth_provider VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'email';
```

2. This column will store values like:
   - 'email' for traditional email/password authentication
   - 'google' for Google Sign-In accounts

3. Update the auth.js route to handle Google authentication (already done)

4. Make sure the Google client ID is properly configured in login.html and register.html (already done)

For full production implementation, you would also:
1. Install the Google Auth Library: `npm install google-auth-library`
2. Add proper token verification in the /api/auth/google route 
3. Add Google Client ID to environment variables
